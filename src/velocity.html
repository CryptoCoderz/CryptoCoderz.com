<br />Velocity BluePaper 
<br />(Prototype Whitepaper)
<br />
<br />Contents:
<br />	1 - Intro
<br />	2 - Importance
<br />	3 - Looking ahead
<br />
<br />1 - Intro: 
<br />Velocity is a re-written feature originally known as "pulse" found in Frycoin. Upon stumbling across this unique feature it <br />became quickly apparent that although significant amounts of code would need to be re-done the feature itself had a very <br />good premise in both security and chain stability aspects. This made it very desirable. Work began to rewrite the code about <br />two weeks ago and has been successfull despite a few small setbacks and bugs that do not actually affect chain stability or <br />coin operation in any way other than intended.
<br />
<br />2 - Importance:
<br />The key importance of Velocity is to constrain the chain with the parameters already defined within the code as apposed to <br />having things like block spacing and other properties act almost as a suggestion to the chain's operation rather than rule <br />and law so to speak. This is very important in the sense that sudden increase in hashrate or possible attacks are still a <br />vulnerability despite the best retarget systems out there being implemented to control block spacing along with network fees, <br />possible invalid ballance issues while sending transactions and other portions of the blockchain that are enforced with a <br />double check but still suseptable to an attack wether it be temporary or a double spend that is confirmed and causes users of <br />the network grief and losses which is unnaceptable. 
<br />This is done by the Velocity system being a "tripple check", even after a block during generation has seemingly met all <br />requirements and is then produced it is now no longer immidiately accepted. Instead it is checked again for inconsistancies and <br />possible other exploits. 
<br />Most notably users will see rejected blocks during the mining or minting phase (or both depending on coin properties), <br />despite the tendency to assume that there is something wrong with the chain as it is rejecting blocks this is in fact a <br />completely normal and a welcomed operation. 
<br />Reasoning is that rapid block times, incorrect fees, insufficient ballance and other issues can be manipulated by a <br />talented programmer with malicous intent. To guard from these kinds of situations Velocity checks the generated block against the <br />chain parameters, first it Velocity checks the block for proper spacing, if the block was generated too quickly it thus has <br />not met one of the main parameters for the chain and is promptly rejected, staving off possilbe attacks and any kind of <br />sudden increase in hashrate. 
<br />Next the system verifies that previously the client that sent a transaction (if it sent one in the previous block) was in <br />fact a valid transaction by comparing previous ballance vs current ballance along with fees paid vs minimum fee required to <br />pay. If any of these parameters are not met (mind you these are standard chain parameters and nothing outlandish) then the <br />block is again rejected despite being generated successfully.
<br />Thus this system secures the chain, making it more stable, predictable, and overall reliable, instilling confidence that <br />the blocks that are accepted are indeed blocks that are proper.
<br />
<br />3 - Shortcomings:
<br />Currently the biggest shortcoming is that this feature is still a prototype system and in its implementation into the <br />Espers blockchain (which is a fully hybrid system utilizing both PoW and PoS simultaniously) caused small glitches with the <br />retarget system which was not functionining properly to begin with as users may remember seeing very rapid block times and the <br />chain rushing over the course of time since its launch until block 650K when Velocity was finally implemented and the chain <br />secured more thoroughly.
<br />That being said users will note that the blocks accepted are spaced very nicely at a minumum of 3.5 minutes without fail <br />and that the chain moves forward smoothly.
<br />Users will also note that however PoS reports incorrectly stating that a reward is due either immenantly (0 seconds) or <br />even states that the user is not staking PoS (whic is not true).
<br />These are merely false reports and users that leave their client running will in fact both stake and mine perfectly <br />normally despite seeing rejected blocks, which simply indicates that the Velocity feature is working to secure out chain.
<br />Next the transaction verification and previous balance checks are currently turned off until such a time as the checks <br />become flawless, the implementation for these specific checks are still being developed to properly assertain those sections of <br />chain parameters. 
<br />Espers itself also being a hybrid blockchain requires a more intuitive retarget approach to reduce rejected blocks and <br />cause the system to properly generate blocks so that Velocity becomes not merely a life support system but merely a security <br />check to a stable and properly operating chain. This is planned to be resolved in the upcoming week.
<br />Users of a Velocity implemented chain may also note that INSANE has now been implemented with this feature, however the <br />issues with Espers will not be apparent in INSANE because INSANE is not a pure PoS coin/token now which does not have the <br />shortcomings of a hybrid system (the shortcomings being that hybrid tokens were never intended to stay hybrid save for Espers and <br />a very select few that suffer from the same rapid block time issues as Espers had suffered from prior to Velocity being <br />implemented) and thus will not have the same issues listed above, in this case INSANE will see only the benefits of Velocity <br />running as a security check merely stabilizing the blockchain further and making it more robust.
<br />
<br />4 - Looking ahead:
<br />Overall the system can be expanded to eventually include more checks, more verification and a even more stringent <br />implementation that may adapt to any kind of features that are added or removed. This makes the system very adaptable and less of <br />a hassle to work with as it can grow with the coin/token and as it becomes more refined and mature so will this new <br />security feature called Velocity.
