<br />Revision 2
<br />Altcoin Block Constraint System
<br />Written by Jonathan Dan Zaretsky - cryptocoderz@gmail.com
<br />
<br />Contents:
<br />	1 - Intro
<br />	2 - Importance
<br />	3 - Shortcomings
<br />	4 - Looking ahead
<br />
<br />1 - Intro: 
<br />Velocity is a tertiary blockchain constraint system designed to ensure stringent block checks and parameter enforcement. This system was designed as a modular/scalable framework and over the years of its use has been expanded to include other check types along with being planned for considerate new check implementation. Showing its usefuleness now in several different blockchain implementations Velocity is looking to be a promising blockchain feature. Example implementations can be found in Espers [ESP], INSaNe [INSN], Rubix [RBX], Nucleon [NEON], and Endox [EDX].
<br />
<br />2 - Importance:
<br />The key importance of Velocity is to constrain the chain with the parameters already defined within the code as apposed to having aspects such as block spacing and other properties act almost as a suggestion to the chain's operation rather than rule and law so to speak. This is very important in the sense that sudden increase in hashrate or possible attacks are still a vulnerability despite the best retarget systems out there being implemented to control block spacing along with network fees, possible invalid ballance issues while sending transactions and other portions of the blockchain that are enforced with a double check but still suseptable to an attack wether it be temporary or a double spend that is confirmed and causes users of the network grief and loss which is unnaceptable. 
This is done by the Velocity system being a "tripple check", even after a block during generation has seemingly met all requirements and is then produced it is now no longer immidiately accepted. Instead it is checked again for inconsistancies and possible other exploits. 
Most notably users will see rejected blocks during the mining or minting phase (or both depending on coin properties), despite the tendency to assume that there is something wrong with the chain as it is rejecting blocks this is in fact a completely normal and a welcomed operation. 
Reasoning is that rapid block times, incorrect fees, insufficient ballance, faked/altered timestamps, altered inputs/outpus and other issues can be manipulated by a talented programmer with malicous intent. To guard from these kinds of situations Velocity checks the generated block against the chain parameters, first it Velocity checks the block for proper spacing, if the block was generated too quickly it thus has not met one of the main parameters for the chain and is promptly rejected, staving off possilbe attacks and any kind of sudden increase in hashrate. Additionally to verifying block spacing Velocity also checks both block timestamp and block transaction timestamp against previously indexed values in order to verify the legitimacy of the timestamp within a block. This is done at least a couple blocks or more deep to ensure timestamp attacks are negated. 
Next the system verifies that previously the client that sent a transaction (if it sent one in the previous block) was in fact a valid transaction by comparing previous ballance vs current ballance along with fees paid vs minimum fee required to pay. If any of these parameters are not met (mind you these are standard chain parameters and nothing outlandish) then the block is again rejected despite being generated successfully.
Thus this system secures the chain, making it more stable, predictable, and overall reliable, instilling confidence that the blocks that are accepted are indeed blocks that are proper.
<br />
<br />3 - Shortcomings:
<br />Currently the biggest shortcoming is that this feature is still a prototype system and as such doesn't intuitively integrate into every blockchain flawlessly. Some can experience issues such as minimum spaced blocks with either min-diff or near min-diff being used which is not an optimal operation of any sort.
Next the transaction verification and previous balance checks are currently turned off until such a time as the checks become flawless, the implementation for these specific checks are still being developed to properly assertain those sections of chain parameters. 
Hybrid blockchains require a more intuitive difficulty retarget approach to reduce rejected blocks and cause the system to properly generate blocks so that Velocity becomes not a life support system but merely a security check to a stable and properly operating chain. 
Users of a Velocity implemented chains may also note that several blockchains have now been implemented with this feature, however the potential issues will not be apparent in them because they are implemented with VRX difficulty retargeting which pairs with Velocity's constraints and thus will not have the same issues listed above, in this case they will see only the benefits of Velocity running as a security check merely stabilizing the blockchain further and making it more robust.
<br />
<br />4 - Looking ahead:
<br />Overall the system can be expanded to eventually include more checks, more verification and a even more stringent implementation that may adapt to any kind of features that are added or removed. This makes the system very adaptable and less of a hassle to work with as it can grow with the coin/token and as it becomes more refined and mature so will this new security feature called Velocity.
